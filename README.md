## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for **Jio**, a major telecommunications company. The goal is to identify churn patterns, understand key metrics driving churn, and provide actionable insights for reducing customer attrition.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For building the interactive dashboard, data modeling, and DAX calculations.
- **SQL (MySQL)**: For data cleaning, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, and pre-processing tasks.

## Key Features
- **Customer Churn Analysis**: Identification of customers likely to leave the service.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizations of churn metrics based on demographics, geography, tenure, payment methods, and services used.
- **Data Insights**: Deep dive into key factors like:
    - Churn Rate by Internet Type
    - Churn Rate by State and Age Group
    - Contract and Tenure Analysis
- **Data Modeling**: Performed using Power BI DAX to ensure optimized performance and accurate calculations.
- **ETL Process**: Raw data was cleaned and transformed in MySQL before loading into Power BI.

## Insights Extracted
1. **High Churn Segments**:
   - Customers on **monthly contracts** exhibit the highest churn rate (46.5%).
   - States like **Jammu** show the highest churn rate (57.2%).

2. **Demographic Trends**:
   - Churn rate is higher among **male customers** (64.15%) compared to females.

3. **Services Analysis**:
   - Customers without **Device Protection Plan** or **Internet Service** have higher churn rates.

4. **Tenure Impact**:
   - Churn rate decreases with customer tenure; customers in their first **6-12 months** are at greater risk.

## Business Impact
By leveraging this dashboard, Jio can:
- Pinpoint customer segments with high churn risk.
- Develop targeted retention strategies (e.g., discounts for monthly contract users).
- Improve service offerings and customer satisfaction.

## How to Use
- Open the Power BI dashboard.
- Interact with filters (Monthly Charge Range, Contract Type, Demographics) to explore insights.
- Use visuals to identify actionable strategies for reducing churn.
